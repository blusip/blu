# BluSIP 

BluSIP, currently, is a library that is utilized for routing, signaling, and transporting voice over the Internet (VoIP). We strive to employ highly efficient solutions to ensure optimal performance of our library. In the future, Blu SIP might evolve into an independent, freely configurable project. Our vision is to integrate a SIP server along with a web server, making the configuration of softphones and WebRTC incredibly simple. At this moment BluSIP is in **pre-alpha** build.
